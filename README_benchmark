Key is of 'int' type in all benchmarks.
Values of keys are 0...N in all tests (I know it is too primitively).

=============
bench_size) This test is very artificial

  a) Hash function is Identity function, i.e. hash_func(k) = k
  b) Key compare function is as fast as it is possible, i.e.
     bool operator < (int, int)
  c) X-axis is a number of elements in array

=============
bench_size65599) Much more real test with real hash function and compare function close to the real one

  a) Hash function is "polynom 65599" (Look at the source code ;-) )
  b) Key compare function is slower than in 'bench_size'
     but is not very slow (slowness_level=SLOW_LEVEL_DEF)
  c) X-axis is a number of elements in array

=============
bench_slowness) This benchmark is about how performance is changed in case of sloooow key comparing function.

  a) Hash function is "polynom 65599" as in 'bench_size65599'
  b) ITEMS_DEF elements in array
  c) X-axis is a slowness of the key comparing function
